In this report, we would do the clustering to label different groups of products with key variables by the K-means algorithm. 
Since there are tons of variables affecting each other, we are trying to reduce the dimensions by principal components
analysis so that we can focus on those dimensions that can explain the most variance of the data. Also, what we want to address 
from the data set in the further analysis are the factors that affect the rating of the product significantly.
In other words, we want to figure out the underlying reasons to make a well-sell product in E-commerce by principal component 
regression. Before the analysis, we come up with a hypothesis to assume that the units sold and rating for the merchants.
